Compiling the project.

Open Visual Basic or double click Make.vbg. Once in VB File->Make Project Group
This will then create devEnv.exe in this folder.
and also engine\engine.exe

That’s it your finished.
Note docs\help.chm for more information the scripting language
This is also viewable from the IDE.

O one quick note I have left a Batch file for UPX.
You can use it compress engine.exe if needed.

UPX can be freely downloaded from http://www.upx.org/
once downloaded place in engine\

Next update should be in one or two days. Until then have fun.
